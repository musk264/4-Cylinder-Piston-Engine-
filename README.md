# 4-Cylinder-Piston-Engine-Design
1.Designed and assembled a 4-cylinder piston engine using SolidWorks, simulating internal combustion engine mechanism.

2.Demonstrated the working of crankshaft, pistons, and valves with realistic motion study and animation.

3.Improved understanding of IC engine kinematics and dynamic part interaction through 3D modeling.

4.Observed smooth power transmission across cylinders and analyzed mechanical synchronization and timing.
